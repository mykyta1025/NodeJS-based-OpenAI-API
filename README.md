For buisness enquires and partnerships you can get in touch with me [here](https://rob-oconnor.com/) 

## Installation

Once you've installed node, navigate to the project directory and run:

### `npm i `

This will install all the dependancies that you need.

##  Get your API key

You'll need to subscribe to a paraphrasing tool API to recieve an API key,
you can get that [here](https://rapidapi.com/healthytechguy/api/paraphrasing-tool1)

Once you've subscribed, copy your API key, navigate to the src directory of this project, open config.json and replace `"YOUR-KEY-HERE"` with your key. 
  

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You now have a paraphrasing tool that can be used for rewriting any body of text you would like.
